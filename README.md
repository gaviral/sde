# SDE

This repository contains a React frontend located in the `frontend/` directory.

## Deployment

The site is automatically built and deployed to **GitHub Pages** whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch. The workflow configuration lives in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

The project uses **Node.js 22**. Ensure this version is installed locally so commands like `npm run build` behave consistently with the CI workflow.
