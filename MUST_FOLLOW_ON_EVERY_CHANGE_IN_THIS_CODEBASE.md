# MUST FOLLOW ON EVERY CHANGE TO THIS CODEBASE:

context: Every time a change is made to the codebase, the environment is setup. The access to internet is only available during this environment setup phase. During this phase, the instructions inside _setup_instructions.txt will be executed automatically by the environment. You (changing the codebase and doing whatever tasks that you are doing) will never have access to the internet throughout your development time doing the task.

- continue to update and maintain _setup_instructions.txt file.
